# myanimelist-data-dashboard
MyAnimeList.net dataset interactive dashboard on R markdown (flexdashboard package)

This is a dashboard about animes (TV, Movies, and others). You can find out details about anime types, genres, evolution, scores, etc. If the first tab gives a first insight of anime world, the two next ones focus on the two main anime types : TV and Movies. The last tab allows you to examine the different anime studios separately.

Check out the “about” tab to know the data sources, inspirations, acknowledgements and tools used here.

The dashboard is fully interactive, do not hesitate to put your mouse on visualisations and try to click on Anime photos to be redirected to the MyAnimeList’s anime page!
